# AirBnBBerlinAnalysis2020
Analysis of AirBnB data if and if yes how the Corona pandemic is visible

This repository is part of a project for my data scientist nanodegree from Udacity. The task is to select a dataset or datasets and apply the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining which was teached in the first lessons of the nanodegree.

Due to the global pandemic I was curious if there are any changes visible in air bnb data of 2020 compared to previous years.
